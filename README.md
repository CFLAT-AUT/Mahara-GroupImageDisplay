### Overview

This plugin displays shared pages in an image display view on a group homepage.

It can be added to the group homepage as a block by the group administrators. Once added, it displays all the shared pages using image icons. There is a mouse hover effect for each of the image icons. It brings up a menu, which provides links to the page itself, the full-size image that is used on the page and the authorâ€™s profile page.

This plugin provides a visually attractive view, compared to the original text based page list. It is based on the functionality of the [Browse Pages plugin](https://github.com/CLTAD/mahara-browse) that is developed by Mike Kelly for the University of the Arts London's Mahara site Workflow.

### Requirement

The Group Image Display plugin requires Mahara 16.10.2 or later.

### Installation

- Put all the files under the folder 'groupviewsimage' and copy the folder to your Mahara installation, inside the document root folder htdocs/blocktype.
- Visit the Site Administration->Extensions->Plugin administration page and install the blocktype/groupviewsimage plugin.
- This plugin sorts the shared pages according to the creation date. There is a change to the core code required for this plugin to work properly.

### Usage

Once this plugin is installed, a block, which is called "Group pages in image display" is avaialble under the General panel when customizing your group homepage. If you drag and drop this content block to the group homepage, it will add the image display view to it. This basically displays the same set of pages as the shared pages, however, in an image display mode.
