### Overview

This plugin displays shared pages in an image display view on a group homepage.

This plugin can be added to the group homepage as a block by the group administrators. Once added, it displays all the shared pages using image icons. There is a mouse hover effect for each of the image icons. It brings up a menu, which provides links to the page itself, the full-size image that is used on the page and the authorâ€™s profile page.

This plugin provides a visually attractive view, compared to the original text based page list. It is based on the functionality of the [Browse Pages plugin](https://github.com/CLTAD/mahara-browse) that is developed by Mike Kelly for the University of the Arts London's Mahara site Workflow.

### Requirement

The Group Image Display plugin requires Mahara 1.6 or later.

### Installation

- Copy the 'groupimagedisplay' folder to your Mahara installation, inside the folder htdocs/blocktype.
- Visit the Site Administration->Extensions->Plugin administration page and install the blocktype/groupimagedisplay plugin.

### Usage

Once this plugin is installed, an artefact, which is called "Group pages in image display" is avaialble when customizing your group homepage. If you drag and drop this artefact to the group homepage, it will add the image display to the homepage.

This basically displays the same set of pages as the shared pages, however, in a image display mode. If there is no image on the page, it will leave it as blank on the image icon. We could do some more detailed tweak on this.
